# Multi-Page Application in React Using API and React Router

## Project Description

This is a multi-page application developed using **React** and **react-router-dom**. The application interacts with the external API (JSONPlaceholder) to retrieve data about users and albums. The main goal of the project is to demonstrate skills in routing, component usage, and adaptive design.

## Application Pages

1. **User List**: Displays all users in the system. Clicking on a user navigates to their detailed information page.
2. **User Page**: Contains information about the user and a list of their photo albums. Clicking on an album navigates to the corresponding album page.
3. **Photo Albums Page**: Shows a list of all albums. Clicking on an album title leads to its photos page.
4. **Album Page**: Displays the photos in the album and the name of the user who created it. Includes a loading indicator while the album data is being loaded.
5. **404 Page**: Shown when attempting to navigate to a non-existent page, with an option to return to the main page.

## Navigation

At the top of the application, there are navigation links:
- **Users** → leads to the user list page.
- **Albums** → leads to the albums list page.

## Technologies

- **React**: A library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: A library for routing in React applications.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: A popular component library for styling the interface, providing modern and adaptive design.
- **Vite**: A build tool and development server.

## Installation and Running
